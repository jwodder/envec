[![Project Status: Abandoned – Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)

This monstrosity is an attempt to create a Python library for scraping the
_Magic: The Gathering_® [Oracle™ card database](http://gatherer.wizards.com)
for all of the Oracle text, rulings, flavor text, set data, etc. for each &
every Magic card and storing it all in JSON & XML files that the library can
then use for offline querying.  It technically works.

**Status**: Horrible and being frequently rewritten to make it less horrible.
Do not use… yet.

Also, for those who still don't get the reference: [Oracle _en_-Vec][3].
