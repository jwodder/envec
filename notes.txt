Function naming conventions:
 - Combining lists (essentially just concatenating and removing duplicates) of
   attributes that describe the whole of a card is referred to as "merging"
 - Combining lists of attributes that describe separate subcards of a card is
   referred to as "joining"
 - Functions for parsing the contents of a string have their names prefixed
   with "parse"
 - Functions for parsing the contents of a file identified by file name have
   their names prefixed with "load"
  - There shouldn't be any functions for parsing the contents of a file
    identified by a filehandle, but loadJSON (et alii?) was apparently written
    while suffering from temporary insanity
