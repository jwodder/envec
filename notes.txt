Function naming conventions:
 - Combining lists (essentially just concatenating and removing duplicates) of
   attributes that describe the whole of a card is referred to as "merging"
 - Combining lists of attributes that describe separate subcards of a card is
   referred to as "joining"
 - Functions for parsing the contents of a string have their names prefixed
   with "parse"
 - Functions for parsing the contents of a file identified by file name have
   their names prefixed with "load"

New vision for what the project should become:
 - There exists a program for fetching the data for & creating JSON & XML files
   of the Oracle database.  All code & routines specific to this task are to be
   hidden from the user by default.
 - There exists a set of Perl modules for reading these JSON & XML files and
   querying the resulting objects for their various properties.
