On the checklist output format:
 - When searching by a single set:
  - Each card link uses the multiverseid of the card's printing in that set.
  - A card that had multiple versions printed in the set (usually basic lands)
    will use the same multiverseid for all of its card links, though how the id
    is selected is unknown.
  - Each half of a split card is listed twice (only for the Invasion block?)
    and has the name of only that half.
  - Each half of a flip or double-faced card is listed separately and has the
    name of only that half.
 - When not searching by set, each card link uses the multiverseid of the
   latest printing.
 - The data is contained in a table of class "checklist".  Each card is
   represented as a <tr class="cardItem"> containing <td>s with the following
   classes:
  - number - collector's number; potentially empty
  - name - contains hyperlinked name (<a class="nameLink">)
  - artist
  - color - slash-separated list
  - rarity - L, C, U, R, or M
  - set
