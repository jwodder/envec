PROBLEMS WITH THE DATA ON GATHERER AND THE SCRAPING THEREOF
- The different faces of double-faced cards have separate multiverseids, even
  though they lead to the same page!
- In all formats other than the individual card details pages, entries for the
  faces of double-faced cards don't give the name of the other face.
- The rules text of basic lands is just the letter of their mana.
- The "{10}" in the rules text of Draco and the "{20}" in the rules text of
  Spawnsire of Ulamog are represented in the text spoilers as "{1}0}" and
  "{2}0}", respectively, with analogous mixing of mana symbols and "0}" in the
  standard & individual spoilers.
- Some (all?) Unglued cards (and Who/What/When/Where/Why in Unhinged) encode
  mana & tap symbols in rules text incorrectly.  Erroneous symbols include:
 - ocT - {T}
 - oW - {W}
 - oU - {U}
 - oB - {B}
 - oR - {R}
 - oG - {G}
 - o2 - {2}
 - o4 - {4}
 - o7 - {7}
 - Consecutive botched mana symbols can even be run together without
   intervening spaces.
- Rules text that is italicized in print (e.g., ability words, "Sarpadian
  Empires, Vol. VII", il- and en- creatures) is not italicized in the spoilers.
- Certain tokens are listed in Gatherer for no good reason (see
  data/tokens.txt), and their card numbers overlap with those of the real cards
  in their sets.
- The Eighth & Ninth Edition "box set" cards have their numbers given without
  the leading 'S', thereby overlapping with the normal card numberings for
  those sets.
- The non-full-art Zendikar lands have their collector's numbers listed without
  the 'a' suffix, thereby overlapping with the full art lands' numbers.
  [Details pages only?]
- [Details format only?] Gatherer has problems with listing the correct artists
  for split cards that have differing artists for each half (i.e., Fire // Ice,
  Illusion // Reality, Life // Death, and Night // Day).
- Various flip cards (the exact set seems to change every update or so) have
  their halves munged together or their bottom halves dropped entirely.
- [Details only] The bottom portions of the Ascendant/Essence cards have their
  top halves' P/T listed as their own.
- Italicization of flavor text is only ever applied to the first
  line/cardtextbox, even though there are some instances (e.g., multiline
  quotations) where it should be done otherwise, and there are some instances
  in which italicized text should be unitalicized (e.g., the name
  "Weatherlight" and the word "compleat").
- Joven is incorrectly listed as a Common.

- Incorrectly transcribed flavor texts:
 - Steamflogger Boss
 - Invasion Plans
 - Pariah (Urza's Saga)
 - Greed (Legends, Fourth Edition, & Fifth Edition, the last two being solely
   incorrect formatting)
 - Squee, Goblin Nabob
 - Thran Golem (Urza's Destiny)
 - Phyresis
 - Whipflare
 - Medicine Bag
 - Mishra's Bauble
 - Venom (The Dark)
 - Raging Bull
 - Battle Mastery
 - Joraga Bard
 - Ember Hauler
 - Dakkon Blackblade (Legends)
 - Withdraw
 - Firestorm Phoenix
 - Sudden Impact
 - Goblin Lookout

- Cards with flavor text listed in Oracle but not with any actually printed on
  the card:
 - Shimmering Wings (Tenth Edition)
 - Paladin en-Vec (Tenth Edition)
 - Pariah (Tenth Edition)
 - Dehydration (Tenth Edition)
 - Primal Rage (Tenth Edition)
 - Spirit Link (Tenth Edition)

- Problems with the text spoilers only:
 - Reminder text and ability words aren't italicized.
 - Snow mana is represented as "{S}i}" (except for the first {S} in the text of
   Frost Raptor, which is simply "{S}i".)
 - Some Unhinged cards (and possibly others?) run consecutive mana symbols
   together, e.g., "{1B}" or "{WW}".
 - The following cards have their names listed incorrectly:
  - Valor - as "XXValor (Valor)" (Timeshifted printing only)
  - Call of the Herd - as "XXCall of the Herd (Call of the Herd)" (Timeshifted
    printing only)
  - Ærathi Berserker - as "rathi Berserker (Ærathi Berserker)"
  - Altar of Dementia - as "Altar Of Dementia (Altar of Dementia)"
  - Knight of Dawn - as "Knight Of Dawn (Knight of Dawn)"
  - The same problem applies to a lesser degree on the corresponding individual
    card details pages, where the unparenthesized names are shown in the large
    heading and the parenthesized names are listed in the "Name:" field.
 - One or more hybrid mana symbols in the following cards' rules texts are
   transcribed incorrectly:
  - Figure of Destiny
  - Rhys the Redeemed
  - Rune-Cervin Rider
  - Crackleburr
  - Creakwood Ghoul
  - Evershrike
  - Mindwrack Liege
  - Mirror Sheen
  - Restless Apparition
  - Stillmoon Cavalier
  - Foxfire Oak
  - Suture Spirit
  - Swirling Spriggan
  - Lashwrithe
