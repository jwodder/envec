PROBLEMS WITH THE DATA ON GATHERER AND THE SCRAPING THEREOF
- The different faces of double-faced cards have separate multiverseids, even
  though they lead to the same page!
- In all formats other than the individual card details pages, entries for the
  faces of double-faced cards don't give the name of the other face.
- The rules text of basic lands is just the letter of their mana.
- The "{10}" in the rules text of Draco and the "{20}" in the rules text of
  Spawnsire of Ulamog are represented in the text spoilers as "{1}0}" and
  "{2}0}", respectively, with analogous mixing of mana symbols and "0}" in the
  standard & individual spoilers.
- Some (all?) Unglued cards (and Who/What/When/Where/Why in Unhinged) encode
  mana & tap symbols in rules text incorrectly.  Erroneous symbols include:
 - ocT - {T}
 - oW - {W}
 - oU - {U}
 - oB - {B}
 - oR - {R}
 - oG - {G}
 - o2 - {2}
 - o4 - {4}
 - o7 - {7}
 - Consecutive botched mana symbols can even be run together without
   intervening spaces.
- Rules text that is italicized in print (e.g., ability words, "Sarpadian
  Empires, Vol. VII", il- and en- creatures) is not italicized in the
  spoilers.
- Certain tokens are listed in Gatherer for no good reason (see
  data/tokens.txt), and their card numbers overlap with those of the real
  cards in their sets.
- The Eighth & Ninth Edition "box set" cards have their numbers given without
  the leading 'S', thereby overlapping with the normal card numberings for
  those sets.
- The non-full-art Zendikar lands have their collector's numbers listed
  without the 'a' suffix, thereby overlapping with the full art lands'
  numbers.  [Details pages only?]
- [Details format only?] Gatherer has problems with listing the correct
  artists for split cards that have differing artists for each half (i.e.,
  Fire // Ice, Illusion // Reality, Life // Death, and Night // Day).
- Various flip cards have problems:
 - Homura's Essence
 - Callow Jushi
 - Hired Muscle
 - The Dark Ascension update made Budoka Pupil and Cunning Bandit (but not
   Callow Jushi and Hired Muscle ... yet) even WORSE.
 - The bottom portions of the Ascendant/Essence cards have their top halves'
   mana costs and (in the card details format only) P/T listed as their own.

- Various flavor texts are formatted incorrectly, e.g., those of:
 - Steamflogger Boss
 - Chub Toad
 - Mesa Chicken
 - Woodland Druid
 - Fool's Tome
 - Phosphorescent Feast (Future Sight)
 - Shapeshifter (Antiquities)
 - Aluren
 - Sacred Nectar
 - A general description of this problem seems to be that italicization is
   only applied to the first line/cardtextbox of each piece of flavor text,
   even though there are some instances where it should be done otherwise.

- Incorrectly transcribed flavor texts:
 - Steamflogger Boss
 - Invasion Plans
 - Pariah (Urza's Saga)
 - Greed (Legends, Fourth Edition, & Fifth Edition, the last two being solely
   incorrect formatting)
 - Squee, Goblin Nabob
 - Thran Golem (Urza's Destiny)
 - Phyresis
 - Whipflare
 - Medicine Bag
 - Mishra's Bauble
 - Venom (The Dark)
 - Raging Bull
 - Battle Mastery
 - Joraga Bard
 - Ember Hauler
 - Dakkon Blackblade (Legends)
 - Withdraw
 - Firestorm Phoenix
 - Sudden Impact
 - Goblin Lookout

- Cards with flavor text listed in Oracle but not with any actually printed on
  the card:
 - Shimmering Wings (Tenth Edition)
 - Paladin en-Vec (Tenth Edition)
 - Pariah (Tenth Edition)
 - Dehydration (Tenth Edition)
 - Primal Rage (Tenth Edition)

- Problems with the text spoilers only:
 - Reminder text and ability words aren't italicized.
 - Snow mana is represented as "{S}i}" (except for the first {S} in the text of
   Frost Raptor, which is simply "{S}i".)
 - Some Unhinged cards (and possibly others?) run consecutive mana symbols
   together, e.g., "{1B}" or "{WW}".
 - The following cards have their names listed incorrectly:
  - Valor - as "XXValor (Valor)" (Timeshifted printing only)
  - Call of the Herd - as "XXCall of the Herd (Call of the Herd)" (Timeshifted
    printing only)
  - Ærathi Berserker - as "rathi Berserker (Ærathi Berserker)"
  - Altar of Dementia - as "Altar Of Dementia (Altar of Dementia)"
  - Knight of Dawn - as "Knight Of Dawn (Knight of Dawn)"
  - The same problem applies to a lesser degree on the corresponding individual
    card details pages, where the unparenthesized names are shown in the large
    heading and the parenthesized names are listed in the "Name:" field.
 - One or more hybrid mana symbols in the following cards' rules texts are
   transcribed incorrectly:
  - Figure of Destiny
  - Rhys the Redeemed
  - Rune-Cervin Rider
  - Crackleburr
  - Creakwood Ghoul
  - Evershrike
  - Mindwrack Liege
  - Mirror Sheen
  - Restless Apparition
  - Stillmoon Cavalier
  - Foxfire Oak
  - Suture Spirit
  - Swirling Spriggan
  - Lashwrithe
