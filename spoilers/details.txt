On the individual card details pages:
 - For a single-part card:
  - The data is contained in a <td> with the id
    "ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_rightCol", which in
    turn contains three <div>s, all with class "smallGreyMono".  The second
    <div> contains a series of <div>s with unique ids and class="row", with
    each sub-<div> containing two more <div>s with the classes "label" and
    "value", in that order.  The possible rows that can appear are:


id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_nameRow"
trim(label) = Card Name:

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_manaRow"
trim(label) = Mana Cost:

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_cmcRow"
trim(label) = Converted Mana Cost:
 - The value may contain extra trailing <br/>s.

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_typeRow"
trim(label) = Types:
 - As printed on the card (e.g., "Creature  â€” Elf Druid"); calling &simplify
   will be necessary.

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_textRow"
trim(label) = Card Text:
 - The "value" div contains a series of <div class="cardtextbox">s, each
   representing one line of the card's rules text.

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_flavorRow"
trim(label) = Flavor Text:
 - The "value" div contains a series of <div class="cardtextbox">s, each
   representing one line of the flavor text (though there isn't always a direct
   correspondence between printed lines and cardtextboxes).  Indentation of
   "citation" lines at the end of flavor text does not seem to be preserved.

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_markRow"
trim(label) = Watermark:
 - The value div uses cardtextboxes for some reason.

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_colorIndicatorRow"
trim(label) = Color Indicator:

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_ptRow"
trim(label) = P/T:

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_ptRow"
trim(label) = Loyalty:

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_ptRow"
trim(label) = Hand/Life:
 - example value (trimmed): "(Hand Modifier: +0 , Life Modifier: +5)"

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_setRow"
trim(label) = Expansion:
 - The value contains a <div> with
   id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_currentSetSymbol"
   that contains two hyperlinks, the first being the expansion symbol (linking
   to the current page) and the second the name of the expansion (linking to
   the standard spoilers for that expansion).

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_rarityRow"
trim(label) = Rarity:
 - The value contains a <span> whose class corresponds to the rarity ("common",
   "mythic", etc.) and which contains the name of the rarity.

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_otherSetsRow"
trim(label) = All Sets:
 - The value contains a <div> with
   id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_otherSetsValue"
   that contains a series of expansion symbol images, each a hyperlink to the
   card's page for its printing in the corresponding set.

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_numberRow"
trim(label) = Card #:

id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_artistRow"
trim(label) = Artist:
 - The value <div> has
   id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_ArtistCredit"
   and contains the name of the artist hyperlinked to a Gatherer search for eir
   other work.

  - Rulings are stored in a <div> with
    id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_rulingsContainer",
    which contains a <table> in which each <tr> (representing a ruling)
    contains two <td>s, the first containing the date of the ruling and the
    second containing the text of the ruling.  Cards which have no rulings do
    not seem to have this <div>.

 - For split, flip, and double-faced cards, all of the relevant IDs for the
   top/front component (including the IDs of the containing <td>s and rulings
   blocks) insert "ctl07_" before the last "word", and the IDs for the
   bottom/back component insert "ctl08_" before the last word.  A parser can
   test whether a card is multipart by first checking for the existence of,
   e.g., "ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_SubContent_SubContent_nameRow", and iff
   no such element is found, the card is multipart.
  - Note that each part of a multipart card is given its own collector's number
    in Gatherer (but only double-faced cards have separate IDs printed on the
    actual card), with the left/top/front's number ending in 'a' and the
    right/bottom/back's ending in 'b'.  However, these suffixes are absent in
    the checklist output format.
  - B.F.M. is presented similarly to a flip/double-faced card, except that the
    infixes are "ctl09_" and "ctl10_", respectively.
