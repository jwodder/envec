NOTES ON SCRAPING SPOILERS FROM GATHERER
- The names of split cards are given in the form "$left // $right
  ($this_subcard)"
- So far, every split card has been homogenously typed (i.e., always either
  Instant // Instant or Sorcery // Sorcery).
- The entries for the flipped portions of flipped cards (when they're separate
  entries in the first place) list the mana costs of the non-flipped portions.

- Problems with the spoilers, regardless of format:
 - In all formats other than the individual card details pages, entries for the
   faces of double-faced cards don't give the name of the other face.
 - Some flip cards are represented by two entries (with the flipped one being
   named "$originalName ($flippedName)"), while others are represented by a
   single entry in which the rules text for the main card is followed by a line
   of four dashes and then all of the text for the flipped card
 - The rules text of basic lands is just the letter of their mana.  (This
   applies to all Oracle formats.)
 - The "{20}" in the rules text of Spawnsire of Ulamog (and possibly other
   uncommon mana symbols) is represented as "{2}0}".  (A similar problem
   applies to the standard and individual card spoilers as well.)
 - Some Unglued cards (and possibly others?) encode mana & tap symbols in rules
   text incorrectly.  Erroneous symbols include:
  - ocT - {T}
  - oW - {W}
  - oU - {U}
  - oB - {B}
  - oR - {R}
  - oG - {G}
  - o2 - {2}
  - o4 - {4}
  - o7 - {7}
  - Consecutive botched mana symbols can even be run together without
    intervening spaces.

- Problems with the text spoilers only:
 - Reminder text and ability words aren't italicized.
 - Snow mana is represented as "{S}i}".
 - Some Unhinged cards (and possibly others?) run consecutive mana symbols
   together, e.g., "{1B}" or "{WW}".
