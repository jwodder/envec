NOTES ON SCRAPING SPOILERS FROM GATHERER
- The names of split cards are given in the form "$left // $right
  ($this_subcard)"
- So far, every split card has been homogenously typed (i.e., always either
  Instant // Instant or Sorcery // Sorcery).
- The entries for the flipped portions of flipped cards (when they're separate
  entries in the first place) list the mana costs of the non-flipped portions.

- On the checklist output format:
 - When searching by a single set:
  - Each card link uses the multiverseid of the card's printing in that set.
  - A card that had multiple versions printed in the set (usually basic lands)
    will use the same multiverseid for all of its card links, though how the id
    is selected is unknown.
 - When not searching by set, each card link uses the multiverseid of the
   latest printing.
 - The data is contained in a table of class "checklist".  Each card is
   represented as a <tr class="cardItem"> containing <td>s with the following
   classes:
    - number - collector's number; potentially empty
    - name - contains hyperlinked name (<a class="nameLink">)
    - artist
    - color - slash-separated list
    - rarity - L, C, U, R, or M
    - set

- Problems with the spoilers, regardless of format:
 - In all formats other than the individual card details pages, entries for the
   faces of double-faced cards don't give the name of the other face.
 - Some flip cards are represented by two entries (with the flipped one being
   named "$originalName ($flippedName)"), while others are represented by a
   single entry in which the rules text for the main card is followed by a line
   of four dashes and then all of the text for the flipped card
 - The rules text of basic lands is just the letter of their mana.
 - The "{20}" in the rules text of Spawnsire of Ulamog (and possibly other
   uncommon mana symbols) is represented as "{2}0}".  (A similar problem
   applies to the standard and individual card spoilers as well.)
  - An analogous problem applies to the "{10}" in the rules text of Draco.
 - Some Unglued cards (and possibly others?) encode mana & tap symbols in rules
   text incorrectly.  Erroneous symbols include:
  - ocT - {T}
  - oW - {W}
  - oU - {U}
  - oB - {B}
  - oR - {R}
  - oG - {G}
  - o2 - {2}
  - o4 - {4}
  - o7 - {7}
  - Consecutive botched mana symbols can even be run together without
    intervening spaces.

   together, e.g., "{1B}" or "{WW}".
