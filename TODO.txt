- Figure out the purpose of the "ampersand bug workaround" that textSpoiler
  inherited from Cockatrice
- Improve handling of split/flip/double-faced cards, possibly by having the
  Card object contain two "subcards"
- Handle leveler cards?
- Abnormal card names to take care of:
 - "rathi Berserker (Ã†rathi Berserker)"
 - "Altar Of Dementia (Altar of Dementia)"
 - "Knight Of Dawn (Knight of Dawn)"

- Handle parse errors in TextSpoiler.pm
- Handle failures in Get.pm functions appropriately
- Give EnVec::Card an inSet(String --> Bool) method
- Rename EnVec::Card's "color" field to distinguish it from colorID

- Move most of envec01.pl into a module containing functions for:
 - Parsing text spoilers, checklists, and standard spoilers in files and
   returning card hashes
 - Parsing an individual card page (identified by multiverseid) and returning a
   Card object
  - Parsing an individual card page for printed (rather than Oracle) text

- Problems with XML::DOM::Lite:
 - Line 160 of Lite::Parser.pm drops newlines at the beginning of text nodes
   for no known reason; this could be worked around by having textContent
   explicitly convert <br/> tags into newlines
 - No textContent method (introduced in DOM 3), so I have to write my own
