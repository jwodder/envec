- Handle XML::DOM::Lite parse errors
- Handle failures in Get.pm functions appropriately
- Add a function for parsing an individual card page (identified by
  multiverseid) and returning a Card object
- Figure out the purpose of the "ampersand bug workaround" that TextSpoiler.pm
  inherited from Cockatrice
- Rewrite & update listify.pl
 - Use the data obtained via details-scraping, not text spoiler & checklist
   scraping
 - Use EnVec::SplitList -- or would 'use open' cause problems?
- Give EnVec::Card a method for getting a card's color (not color ID)
- EnVec::Card->showField should treat a negative width as disabling
  line-wrapping
- Rewrite the representation of multipart cards to mirror that in mtgcard.dtd
- Rename EnVec::Card->isSplit to 'isMultipart'
- Give EnVec::SplitList functions for getting the alternate components of given
  halves of multipart cards
- Give dumpArray and dumpHash arguments for dumping to a filehandle
- Add a means to read EnVec::Card objects from a JSON file one at a time rather
  than all at once
- Give EnVec.pm tags for the export lists of each submodule
- Make EnVec.pm preserve the non-'all' tags of the submodules
- Handle leveler cards?
- Add a function for parsing standard spoilers?
- Add a function for parsing an individual card page for printed (rather than
  Oracle) text?
- Add files to data/ for:
 - The release dates of the different Vanguard card sets
 - The release dates of the various promo cards
 - Timeshifted cards in Planar Chaos and Future Sight?
 - Promo cards not in Gatherer
- For the multiversion cards in rarities.tsv, give each entry a field for the
  multiverseid and another field for a short description that a mortal can use
  to identify the version
- Use a more widespread/reliable XML parsing library than XML::DOM::Lite
