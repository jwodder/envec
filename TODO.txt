- Fix newline handling (see below)
- Figure out the purpose of the "ampersand bug workaround" that
  importTextSpoiler inherited from the Cockatrice source
- Make split cards properly merge mana costs 
 - Note: The names of split cards are given in the form "$left // $right
   ($this_subcard)"
- Improve handling of split/flip/double-faced cards in general, possibly by
  having the Card object contain two "subcards"
- Scrape "Loyalty:", "Set/Rarity:", "Color:" (color indicators for double-faced
  cards), and "Hand/Life:" fields

- Give Card.pm a method for determining the card's color identity
- Give Card.pm a method for merging objects describing the same card (e.g.,
  merging their set information)

- Move most of envec01.pl into a module containing functions for:
 - Downloading text spoilers, checklists, and standard spoilers (identified by
   set name) to files, with an option controlling whether to mirror or not
 - Parsing text spoilers, checklists, and standard spoilers in files and
   returning card hashes
 - Parsing an individual card page (identified by multiverseid) and returning a
   Card object
  - Parsing an individual card page for printed (rather than Oracle) text
 - Merging card hashes
 - Loading Card JSON data from files

- Problems with the text spoilers:
 - Entries for the faces of double-faced cards don't give the name of the other
   face.
 - Reminder text isn't italicized.
 - Some flip cards are represented by two entries (with the flipped one being
   named "$originalName ($flippedName)"), while others are represented by a
   single entry in which the rules text for the main card is followed by a line
   of four dashes and then all of the text for the flipped card
 - The "{20}" in the rules text of Spawnsire of Ulamog (and possibly other
   obscure mana symbols) is represented as "{2}0}".  (A similar problem applies
   to the standard and individual card spoilers as well.)

- Problems with XML::DOM::Lite:
 - Line 160 of Lite::Parser.pm drops newlines at the beginning of text nodes
   for no known reason; this could be worked around by having textContent
   explicitly convert <br/> tags into newlines
 - No textContent method (introduced in DOM 3), so I have to write my own
