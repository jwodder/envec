- Figure out the purpose of the "ampersand bug workaround" that textSpoiler
  inherited from Cockatrice
- Make split cards properly merge mana costs 
 - Note: The names of split cards are given in the form "$left // $right
   ($this_subcard)"
- Improve handling of split/flip/double-faced cards in general, possibly by
  having the Card object contain two "subcards"

- Finish EnVec::Card::colorID
- Handle parse errors in TextSpoiler.pm
- Handle failures in Get.pm functions appropriately
- Give EnVec::Card an inSet(String --> Bool) method

- Move most of envec01.pl into a module containing functions for:
 - Parsing text spoilers, checklists, and standard spoilers in files and
   returning card hashes
 - Parsing an individual card page (identified by multiverseid) and returning a
   Card object
  - Parsing an individual card page for printed (rather than Oracle) text

- Problems with the text spoilers:
 - Entries for the faces of double-faced cards don't give the name of the other
   face.
 - Reminder text isn't italicized.
 - Some flip cards are represented by two entries (with the flipped one being
   named "$originalName ($flippedName)"), while others are represented by a
   single entry in which the rules text for the main card is followed by a line
   of four dashes and then all of the text for the flipped card
 - The "{20}" in the rules text of Spawnsire of Ulamog (and possibly other
   uncommon mana symbols) is represented as "{2}0}".  (A similar problem
   applies to the standard and individual card spoilers as well.)
 - The rules text of basic lands is just the letter of their mana.  (This
   applies to all Oracle formats.)

- Problems with XML::DOM::Lite:
 - Line 160 of Lite::Parser.pm drops newlines at the beginning of text nodes
   for no known reason; this could be worked around by having textContent
   explicitly convert <br/> tags into newlines
 - No textContent method (introduced in DOM 3), so I have to write my own
