- Robustness:
 - Handle XML::DOM::Lite parse errors
 - Handle failures in Get.pm functions appropriately
 - Use a more widespread/reliable XML parsing library than XML::DOM::Lite
 - Try to handle fractions in Unhinged cards?
 - Try to handle Erase (Not the Urza's Legacy One)?

- Features:
 - Add a function for parsing an individual card page (identified by
   multiverseid) and returning a Card object
 - Give EnVec::SplitList functions for getting the alternate components of
   given halves of multipart cards
 - Add a means to read EnVec::Card objects from a JSON file one at a time
   rather than all at once
 - Give dumpArray and dumpHash arguments for dumping to a filehandle
 - Add special handling for leveler cards
 - Give EnVec::Card toXML and fromXML methods
 - EnVec::Card->showField1 should treat a negative width as disabling
   line-wrapping

- Coding:
 - Rewrite the representation of multipart cards to mirror that in mtgcard.dtd
 - Make fromJSON a class method of EnVec::Card
 - Give EnVec.pm tags for the export lists of each submodule
 - Make EnVec.pm preserve the non-'all' tags of the submodules
 - Make EnVec::Card::Content automatically convert empty fields to undef
 - Make EnVec::Card::Content prohibit empty names
 - Make EnVec::Card only allow valid cardType values

- Rewrite/update listify.pl
- Consider just deleting TextSpoiler.pm (and then COPYING)

- Data & documentation:
 - Add documentation
 - Rewrite spoilers.txt so that it makes sense to other people
 - Add files to data/ for:
  - The release dates of the different Vanguard card sets
  - The release dates of the various promo cards
  - Timeshifted cards in Planar Chaos and Future Sight?
  - Promo cards not in Gatherer
  - Multiversion cards not in rarities.tsv (e.g., alternate-art foils from the
    Invasion block)
  - The Anthologies, Deckmasters, & Duels of the Planeswalkers (et alii?) sets
 - For the multiversion cards in rarities.tsv, give each entry a field for the
   multiverseid and another field for a short description that a mortal can use
   to identify the version
 - Add Cockatrice's abbreviations to abbrevs.tsv?

- Ideas for later:
 - Add a function for parsing standard spoilers?
 - Add a function for parsing an individual card page for printed (rather than
   Oracle) text
 - Add elements to mtgcard.dtd for storing printed text, expansion symbols,
   card language, etc.
