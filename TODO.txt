- Robustness:
 - Handle XML::DOM::Lite parse errors
 - Handle failures in Get.pm functions appropriately
 - Use a more widespread/reliable XML parsing library than XML::DOM::Lite
 - Uncards:
  - Try to handle fractions in Unhinged cards?
  - Try to handle Erase (Not the Urza's Legacy One)?
  - Try to handle BFM?

- Features:
 - Add special handling for leveler cards
 - Give EnVec::Card toXML and fromXML methods
 - Completely rewrite JSON.pm
  - Rename fromJSON "fromHash", make it a class method of EnVec::Card, and add
    a *real* fromJSON method that takes a string of JSON as input
  - Give dumpArray and dumpHash arguments for dumping to a filehandle
 - Add a means to read EnVec::Card objects from a JSON/XML file one at a time
   rather than all at once
 - Give EnVec::SplitList a cardType function
 - Give EnVec::SplitList more functions for getting the alternate components of
   given halves of multipart cards?
 - EnVec::Card->showField1 should treat a negative width as disabling
   line-wrapping
 - Support fetching & storing format legality information

- Coding:
 - Rewrite/update Card->merge and mergePrintings (and then update insertCard)
 - Overload stringification of Multival objects
 - Give EnVec.pm tags for the export lists of each submodule
 - Make EnVec.pm preserve the non-'all' tags of the submodules
 - Ensure that the printings fields of Card objects are always sorted?
 - Ensure that the multiverseid fields (et alii?) of Printing objects are
   always sorted?
 - Give EnVec::Card a toHash method?
 - Make the storage of Content->text fields mirror their representation in
   mtgcard.dtd
 - Runtime type enforcement:
  - Make EnVec::Card only allow valid cardType values
  - Make EnVec::Card::Content prohibit empty names
  - Make EnVec::Card::Content automatically convert empty fields to undef
 - Represent rarities by enums?  At the very least, make their representations
   consist (e.g., 'Mythic Rare' vs. 'Mythic rare' vs. 'mythic rare' vs.
   'Mythic' vs. ...) and abstract away the conversions between long rarity
   names and single characters.

- Rewrite/update listify.pl
- Rename SplitList.pm to Multipart.pm?
- Consider just deleting TextSpoiler.pm (and then COPYING)
- Rename "cardType" to "cardClass" or "class"?

- Data & documentation:
 - Add documentation
 - Rewrite spoilers.txt so that it makes sense to other people
 - Add files to data/ for:
  - The release dates of the different Vanguard card sets
  - The release dates of the various promo cards
  - Timeshifted cards in Planar Chaos and Future Sight?
  - Promo cards not in Gatherer
  - Multiversion cards not in rarities.tsv (e.g., alternate-art foils from the
    Invasion block)
  - The Anthologies, Deckmasters, & Duels of the Planeswalkers (et alii?) sets
 - For the multiversion cards in rarities.tsv, give each entry a field for the
   multiverseid and another field for a short description that a mortal can use
   to identify the version
 - Add Cockatrice's abbreviations to abbrevs.tsv?

- Ideas for later:
 - Add a function for parsing standard spoilers?
 - Add a function for parsing an individual card page for printed (rather than
   Oracle) text
 - Add elements to mtgcard.dtd for storing printed text, expansion symbols,
   card language, etc.
 - Implement Card->showField1('printings')
 - Add a wrapper around parseDetails that downloads and parses a given
   multiverseid?
