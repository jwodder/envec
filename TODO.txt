- Handle flip and double-faced cards
- Abnormal card names to handle:
 - "rathi Berserker (Ã†rathi Berserker)"
 - "Altar Of Dementia (Altar of Dementia)"
 - "Knight Of Dawn (Knight of Dawn)"
- Handle leveler cards?
- Figure out the purpose of the "ampersand bug workaround" that TextSpoiler.pm
  inherited from Cockatrice
- Handle parse errors in TextSpoiler.pm
- Handle failures in Get.pm functions appropriately
- Give EnVec::Card a method for getting a card's color, ignoring color ID?
- EnVec::Card->showField should treat a negative width as disabling
  line-wrapping
- Add functions for parsing checklists & standard spoilers in files
- Add a function for parsing an individual card page (identified by
  multiverseid) and returning a Card object
- Add a function for parsing an individual card page for printed (rather than
  Oracle) text?
- Add a means to read EnVec::Card objects from a JSON file one at a time rather
  than all at once
- Give EnVec.pm tags for the export lists of each submodule
- Make EnVec.pm preserve the non-'all' tags of the submodules
- Give dumpArray and dumpHash arguments for dumping to a filehandle

- Problems with XML::DOM::Lite:
 - Line 160 of Lite::Parser.pm drops newlines at the beginning of text nodes
   for no known reason; this could be worked around by having textContent
   explicitly convert <br/> tags into newlines
 - No textContent method (introduced in DOM 3), so I have to write my own
