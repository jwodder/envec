- Robustness:
 - Handle XML::DOM::Lite parse errors
 - Handle failures in Get.pm functions appropriately
 - Use a more widespread/reliable XML parsing library than XML::DOM::Lite

- Features:
 - Make the code faster
 - Implement the rest of the features for details.pl
 - Add a means to read EnVec::Card objects from a JSON/XML file one at a time
   rather than all at once
 - Add special handling for leveler cards
 - Give EnVec::Card a fromXML method
 - Give EnVec::Multipart a cardClass function
 - Give EnVec::Multipart more functions for getting the alternate components of
   given halves of multipart cards?
 - EnVec::Card->showField1 should treat a negative width as disabling
   line-wrapping
 - Fix/improve the PostScript output of listify.pl

- Coding:
 - Represent rarities by enums?  At the very least, make their representations
   consistent (e.g., 'Mythic Rare' vs. 'Mythic rare' vs. 'mythic rare' vs.
   'Mythic' vs. ...) and abstract away the conversions between long rarity
   names and single characters.
 - Make the storage of Content->text fields mirror their representation in
   mtgcard.dtd
 - Runtime type enforcement:
  - Make EnVec::Card only allow valid cardClass values
  - Make EnVec::Card::Content prohibit empty names
  - Make EnVec::Card::Content automatically convert empty fields to undef
 - Give EnVec::Card a toHashref method
 - Give EnVec.pm tags for the export lists of each submodule
 - Make EnVec.pm preserve the non-'all' tags of the submodules
 - Ensure that the printings fields of Card objects are always sorted?
 - Ensure that the multiverseid fields (et alii?) of Printing objects are
   always sorted?
 - Overload stringification of Multival objects?

- Data & documentation:
 - Add documentation
 - Rewrite spoilers/* so that it makes sense to other people
 - For the multiversion cards in rarities.tsv, give each entry a field for the
   multiverseid and another field for a short description (to become the
   'notes' field) that a mortal can use to identify the version
 - Add files to data/ for:
  - Promo cards not in Gatherer
  - The release dates of the various promo cards
  - The release dates of the different Vanguard card sets
  - The Anthologies, Deckmasters, & Duels of the Planeswalkers (et alii?) sets
  - Multiversion cards not in rarities.tsv (e.g., alternate-art foils from the
    Invasion block, Brothers Yamazaki)
  - Timeshifted cards in Planar Chaos and Future Sight?
 - Add Cockatrice's abbreviations to abbrevs.tsv?

- For later:
 - Implement Card->showField1('printings')
 - Handle Uncards, specifically:
  - BFM
  - Who/What/When/Where/Why
  - fractions in Unhinged cards
 - Support fetching & storing format legality information
 - Add a function for parsing an individual card page for printed (rather than
   Oracle) text
 - Add elements to mtgcard.dtd for storing printed text, expansion symbols,
   card language, etc.
 - Add a wrapper around parseDetails that downloads and parses a given
   multiverseid?
