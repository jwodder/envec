POSSIBLE STRUCTURE FOR A SQL DATABASE OF CARDS
- "cards" table; columns:
 - cardID - int
  - The cardID of a card is its index (zero based?) in a lexicographically
    sorted list of cards in which each card is a (set, card-name) pair, each
    card name is only paired with the set in which it was first printed
    chronologically, and sets are sorted in chronological order.
   - Card names are in UTF-8.
   - Split card names are in the form "left // right".
   - Flip and double-faced cards are assigned the names of their primary
     components.
   - Problem: promo cards
 - subcard - int
  - 0 - whole of a "standard" card; left half of a split card; top of a flip
    card; front of a double-faced card

    double-faced card
