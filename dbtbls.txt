POSSIBLE STRUCTURE FOR A SQL DATABASE OF CARDS
- "cards" table
 - cardID - int
  - The cardID of a card is its zero-based index in a lexicographically sorted
    list of cards in which each card is a (set, card-name) pair, card names are
    in UTF-8 and compared bytewise, each card name is only paired with the set
    in which it was first printed, and sets are sorted in chronological order.
    Problem: promo cards
 - name - string
 - cost - string or NULL
 - rulesText - string
 - indicator - colors bitfield or NULL
 - power, toughness, loyalty, handMod, lifeMod - int or NULL
 - altCard - int or NULL - If the row represents the left/top/front portion of
   a split/flip/double-faced card, this is the cardID of the right/bottom/back
   portion; otherwise, it is NULL.
  - Should any effort at all be made at accomodating Unhinged's
    "Who/What/When/Where/Why"?
 - cardType - enum for standard, split, flip, or double-faced

- "types" table
 - cardID
 - level - enum for supertype, type, or subtype
 - index (in the list of supertypes/types/subtypes printed on the card)
 - type - string (or index into another table?)

- "printings" table
 - cardID
 - multiverseid - int, non-NULL
  - Ideally, it would be nice if the multiverseids could be unique throughout
    the table, but this would require merging the data for the halves of split
    and flip cards (Double-faced cards have separate IDs for each face).
 - set - int - cross-reference to "sets" table
 - rarity - enum for land, common, uncommon, rare, mythic, or special
  - Should the old rarities system be supported?
 - artist - string
 - number - int or NULL
 - watermark - string or NULL
 - flavorText - string or NULL

- "sets" table
 - setID
 - long name
 - short name
 - release date
 - set type? (core set, expansion, casual supplement, etc.)

- "rulings" table
 - cardID
 - date
 - text
 - How exactly should split/flip cards with rulings be handled?  (Double-faced
   cards have separate rulings for each face.)

- "formats" table (optional)
 - cardID
 - formatName
 - legality - enum for legal, restricted, or banned
