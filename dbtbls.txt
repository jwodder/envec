POSSIBLE STRUCTURE FOR A SQL DATABASE OF CARDS
- Enumerations:
 - "subcard" values:
  - ??? - whole of a "standard" card; left half of a split card; top of a flip
    card; front of a double-faced card
  - ??? - right half of a split card; bottom of a flip card; back of a
    double-faced card
 - type "levels" - supertype, type, subtype
 - rarities?
 - cardType?

- "cards" table; columns:
 - cardID - int
  - The cardID of a card is its index (zero based?) in a lexicographically
    sorted list of cards in which each card is a (set, card-name) pair, each
    card name is only paired with the set in which it was first printed
    chronologically, and sets are sorted in chronological order.
   - Card names are in UTF-8.
   - Split card names are (for the purpose of assigning cardIDs) in the form
     "left // right".
   - Flip and double-faced cards are assigned the names of their primary
     components.
