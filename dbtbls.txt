POSSIBLE STRUCTURE FOR A SQL DATABASE OF CARDS
- "cards" table; columns:
 - cardID - int
  - The cardID of a card is its index (zero based?) in a lexicographically
    sorted list of cards in which each card is a (set, card-name) pair, each
    card name is only paired with the set in which it was first printed
    chronologically, and sets are sorted in chronological order.
   - Card names are in UTF-8.
   - Split card names are in the form "left // right".
   - Flip and double-faced cards are assigned the names of their primary
     components.
   - Problem: promo cards
 - subcard - int
  - 0 - whole of a "standard" card; left half of a split card; top of a flip
    card; front of a double-faced card
  - 1 - right half of a split card; bottom of a flip card; back of a
    double-faced card
 - name - string
 - cost - string or NULL
 - rulesText - string of some type
 - color-indicator - colors bitfield or NULL
 - power, toughness, loyalty, handMod, lifeMod - int or NULL
 - cardType - "standard", "split", "flip", or "double-faced" (or enum
   representations thereof)

- "types" table
 - cardID
 - subcard
 - level (supertype, type, subtype)
 - index (in the list of supertypes/types/subtypes printed on the card)
 - type - string or index into another table

- "printings" table; columns:
 - cardID
 - set - int - cross-reference to "sets" table
 - rarity
 - collectorNum - int or NULL
 - multiverseid - int
 - artist - string - Multipart cards use the same artist for each part, right?
 - watermark - string or NULL
 - flavorText - string ? - This would necessitate adding a "subcard" column.
 - Idea: Rather than giving each subcard a separate row (which would lead to
   non-uniqueness of multiverseids, which is not desirable), any "artist",
   "watermark", and/or "flavorText" values that differ between subcards could
   be handled by joining the conflicting values together with some unambiguous
   separator ("\f"?) and then storing this concatenated value.

- "sets" table; columns:
 - [ID]
 - long name
 - short name
 - release date
 - set type? (core set, expansion, casual supplement, etc.)

- "rulings" table
 - cardID
 - subcard - Double-faced cards have separate rulings for each face; WHYâ€½
 - date
 - text
